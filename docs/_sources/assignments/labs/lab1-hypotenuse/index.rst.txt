Lab1: Calculating the Hypotenuse
################################

..  note::

    This project will be graded as a lab, but you are to place it in your
    homework repository, in a folder named "LAB1". Future lab work will be in
    separate repositories.

..  include::   /references.inc

As a simple check to see if you can put together a basic C++ program. In this
lab, you will build a simple program that does the following:

Display a Header
****************

All programs should identify themselves (at least in this class!) Make your
program display the following text:

..  code-block:: text

    Finding the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
    Author: <Your Name>

Ask the User for Input
**********************

Next, prompt the user to enter two numers. Tell them what to enter with a prompt:

..  code-block:: text

    Enter the length of the first side (as a floating point number):

Read the input number and store it in a suitable variable. Prompt the user in a
similar way for the second side length.

Find the Final Length
*********************

You should know the formula for this part. Set up an expression to evaluate
this final value, and store it in a suitable variable.

Display the Result
******************

Finally, output the final result:

..  code-block:: text

    The length of the hypotenuse is xxxx.xxxx

Looping
*******

To make this more interesting, wrap all of this (Except the header) in a loop.
You will stop the program when the length of the first side is a negative
number.

What to Turn In
***************

You will submit all of your work using your GitHub_ account, placing your
project in a folder named "LAB1". (Remember that for this lab only, you will
place this in your homework repository.) 

When is This Due?
*****************

Unless told otherwise, all labs and homework are due on the Sunday of the week
they are assigned.
