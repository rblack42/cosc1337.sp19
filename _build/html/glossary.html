<dt id="term-avatar">Avatar</dt>
<dd>A graphical representation of a user. Often an image, but it can be a
cartoon-like character as well. To make the web more personal (and less

<dt id="term-baby-step">Baby Step<dt id="term-baby-steps">Baby Steps</dt>
<dd>A software development process that focuses on making very small
changes to your code, followed by a quick test using the compiler to
make sure you can run your code, and a run that generates output you
can inspect to see how your changes are working. The key to this is
doing this sequence often.</dd>
<dt id="term-220">baby steps</dt>
<dd>A programming style where you make small changes to a working program
to get another working program that is closer to the final solution. Do
not move on until the new program works!</dd>

<dd>An <a class="reference internal" href="#term-old-school"><span class="xref std std-term">old school</span></a> method of software development. This method
involves long sessions of writing code with few attempts to test the
code. The result is often long sessions fixing typing mistakes,
followed by long sessions with a debugger trying to figure out why
things do not work.</dd>
<dt id="term-221">blasting code</dt>
<dd>A term used to indicate long sessions furiously writing code in the
hope you can get things running by a deadline. It is the exact opposite

<dt id="term-change-script">Change Script<dt id="term-change-scripts">Change Scripts</dt>
<dd>This is a chunk of code that can be used by an appropriate tool to
convert one product into another one. These scripts are the heart of
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-source-code-control-systems"><span class="xref std std-term">source code control systems</span></a>. The Unix tool <strong class="program">diff</strong> is
used to create such scripts.</dd>
<dt id="term-clone">Clone</dt>
<dd>Create a copy of files living on a remote server for your local use.
This creates a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-working-copy"><span class="xref std std-term">working copy</span></a> of the project. You may (or may
not) have rights to make changes and <a class="reference internal" href="#term-push"><span class="xref std std-term">push</span></a> them back up. It is
common to <a class="reference internal" href="#term-clone"><span class="xref std std-term">clone</span></a> project hosted on services like GitHub so you
can use the code or study it. You can update your local copy at any
time to keep up with changes in the project.</dd>
<dt id="term-cloud">Cloud</dt>
<dd>The funny new term we use to refer to machines “out ther” somewhere on the Internet.</dd>
<dt id="term-code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</dt>
<dd>Every profession has a defined set of rules they expect members of that
profession to follow. Most of the time, these rules are common sense,
but they are defined to make sure every member understands what the
profession seeks to present itself to the public. You are expected to
know these rules and follow them when you join the profession. Look
into each profession’s primary organization for guidance. For computer
folks, this is probably the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.acm.org">Association for Computing Machinery</a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-command">Command</dt>
<dd>A series of space-separated text items handed to the operating system.
The first of these items is the name of some program (which may be
internal to the operating system) you want to run. The rest of the
items are called <a class="reference internal" href="#term-parameters"><span class="xref std std-term">parameters</span></a> which are processed by the program
and control exactly what that program does.</dd>
<dt id="term-40">Command Line</dt>
<dd>A simple text line on your screen where you can type in a
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-command"><span class="xref std std-term">command</span></a> to the operating system.</dd>
<dt id="term-comment">Comment<dt id="term-comments">Comments</dt>
<dd>Short chunks of text added to program code that seeks to explain when
is going on. Far too often, this text just repeats what the code
actually says, making them useless. Comments should explain the “why” of
a block of code.</dd>
<dt id="term-commit">Commit<dt id="term-commits">Commits</dt>
<dd><a class="reference internal" href="#term-push"><span class="xref std std-term">push</span></a> to a remote server.</dd>

has at this moment, even as the project continues on in its
development.</dd>
<dt id="term-compile">Compile<dt id="term-compiler">Compiler<dt id="term-compilers">Compilers</dt>
<dd>When we process a program written in a high-level programming language,
the tool we use is called a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-compiler"><span class="xref std std-term">compiler</span></a>. That tool converts our
program into the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-machine-language"><span class="xref std std-term">machine language</span></a> the processor actually
understands.. We say we <a class="reference internal" href="#term-compile"><span class="xref std std-term">compile</span></a> our programs.</dd>
<dt id="term-conflict">Conflict<dt id="term-conflicts">Conflicts</dt>

objects. Used by <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> internally to store version information.</dd>
<dt id="term-context-free">Context Free</dt>
<dd>A programming language must be defined in such a way that figuring out
what should come next (<a class="reference internal" href="#term-tokens"><span class="xref std std-term">tokens</span></a>) can be figured out without
studying the context in which the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-token"><span class="xref std std-term">token</span></a> appears.</dd>
<dt id="term-context-menu">Context Menu</dt>
<dd>On most systems, when you <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">right-click</kbd> on something, you bring up
a menu that is sensitive to the context of the thing you are pointing
to. That menu lets you perform tasks common to that thing!</dd>
<dt id="term-continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</dt>
<dd>A testing technique where a project is automatically tested on a number
of build systems to verify that the project is running properly. By
testing automatically, developers can spot major problems that cause
errors on specific platforms quickly.</dd>
<dt id="term-cookie">Cookie</dt>
<dd>A small file containing information needed to reconnect you to a web
server automatically. Cookies often store log in credentials. It is
vital that you never allow your personal cookies to be saved on a
public machine. Doing so gives others complete access to your accounts.
Parameter Parameters A block of text (no spaces allowed, unless the
block is enclosed in quotes) that is passed to a program or a
sub-program. If passed to a program and there are more than one
parameter needed, they are usually separated by spaces. If passed to a
sub-program, they are usually separated by commas.</dd>
<dt id="term-current">Current</dt>
<dd>This is the flow of electrons through a circuit. Moving electrons
generate heat and electromagnetic waves as a by-product of this motion.</dd>
<dt id="term-data">data</dt>
<dd>A set of bits in memory representing an encoded thing from our human
world.</dd>
<dt id="term-data-alignment">Data Alignment</dt>
<dd>Modern processors work best when data is aligned so that the data item
fits in a natural data chunk the processor will fetch. Misalignment
problems occur when a single data item requires two memory accesses to
access.</dd>
<dt id="term-data-type">data type</dt>
<dd>Specifies the size of a data container needed to store values, and the
rules to use to manipulate that data.</dd>
<dt id="term-ddns">DDNS<dt id="term-dyndns">DynDNS<dt id="term-dynamic-dns">Dynamic DNS</dt>
<dd>A service that updates <a class="reference internal" href="#term-dns"><span class="xref std std-term">DNS</span></a> tables used by Internet services to
map domain names to addresses. These services are helpful if your
network address changes often, as it might if you are working from home
and want to set up a server.</dd>
<dt id="term-debugger">Debugger</dt>
<dd>A software development tool that is used to step a program one line at
a time, then allows the developer to inspect the internal state of the
machine as the program runs. They are a vital, and often under-used
tool in programming.</dd>
<dt id="term-decode">Decode</dt>
<dd>After the processor has <a class="reference internal" href="#term-fetched"><span class="xref std std-term">fetched</span></a> part of an instruction, it
decodes that part to determine what additional information it needs to
do its work. If it needs more data from memory, that data will be read
from memory into internal registers. As part of this step, the complete
size of the instruction is calculated, and the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-ip"><span class="xref std std-term">IP</span></a> register is
updated to point to the next instruction in memory.</dd>
<dt id="term-desk-checking">desk checking</dt>
<dd>Thinking your way through a piece of code manually. You record the
values of all variables involved, and determining exactly how the code
will <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">flow</span></code>.</dd>
<dt id="term-diff">Diff<dt id="term-difference">Difference</dt>
<dd>A tool can read two files and show the differences between them. It can
also create a <cite>patch</cite> file that can be used to convert one of them into
the other.</dd>
<dt id="term-directory">Directory<dt id="term-directory-tree">Directory Tree</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The <a class="reference internal" href="#term-operating-system"><span class="xref std std-term">operating system</span></a> on most computers, today, uses tree-like
structure to store files.  The top of this tree, called the root of the
tree, is a directory (or folder as Microsoft want us to call it). The
name of this directory is either “/” on a Linux/Mac system, or “” on a
Windows system.</p>
<p class="last">A Directory is a container that can hold either files (objects that
contain only data, such as text, images, of other binary data) or other
directory objects (called subdirectories). Subdirectories have names
that follow the rules for the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-operating-system"><span class="xref std std-term">operating system</span></a>.  Any directory
or subdirectory can hold files of further subdirectories, giving the
entire file system a (upside down) tree-like structure.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-dns">DNS<dt id="term-domain-name-service">Domain Name Service</dt>
<dd>A phone book like service that maps domain names, like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">www.pylit.org</span></code>,
to an IP address.</dd>
<dt id="term-domain-name">Domain Name</dt>
<dd>Servers on the Internet are all part of some registered domain, which
has a name associated with it. I own <cite>pylit.org</cite> for example. The last
part is used to brand the kind of domain I am part of, in this case a
non-profit organization. The first part is often chosen to identify the
company involved. You can add a machine name to the front of this
name. Often <cite>www</cite> is tacked on to identify a web server where the
companies website is found.</dd>
<dt id="term-dotfiles">DotFiles</dt>
<dd>Many programs keep settings in a hidden file in the user’s <a class="reference internal" href="#term-home-directory"><span class="xref std std-term">home
directory</span></a>. Exactly what these file hold depends on the program. It is
common to manage these files in some way. I keep mine on my <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
account at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rblack42/dotfiles">https://github.com/rblack42/dotfiles</a>.</dd>

This effectively isolates the environment inside the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-96"><span class="xref std std-term">VM</span></a> from
the host computer.</dd>

<dd>A <a class="reference internal" href="#term-97"><span class="xref std std-term">virtual machine</span></a> set up on a remote server in such a way that
a user can use the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-96"><span class="xref std std-term">VM</span></a> as a private serer. This arrangement is
commonly used by companies to make more effective use of physical
servers. Multiple <a class="reference internal" href="#term-vps"><span class="xref std std-term">VPS</span></a> systems can run on one physical machine.
Companies like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> offer access to such systems.</dd>

<dd>When using an <a class="reference internal" href="#term-sccs"><span class="xref std std-term">SCCS</span></a> system, the copy maintained on a remote
server is usually treated as a master copy. Any local copies are called
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-working-copies"><span class="xref std std-term">working copies</span></a>. When you leave any work session, you should try
to make sure the remote and working copies are identical. This will
prevent problems later!</dd>
